## How to dev

### Multichain Deployment Workflow

Follow these steps to prepare and deploy a subgraph across multiple networks:

1. Run the prepare command with the target network. Example: `yarn prepare matic`
2. Execute the following commands to reset and prepare the subgraph: `yarn clean && yarn codegen && yarn build`
3. Authenticate with `graph auth --studio <key>`
4. Deploy with `graph deploy <name>` or `goldsky subgraph deploy stability-sonic/<version> --path .`

### Add chain

1. Add to networks.json
2. Add to functions.ts
3. Add to constants.ts
